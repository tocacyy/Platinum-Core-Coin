Official Development Tree.

Platinum-Core-Coin - a hybrid scrypt PoW + PoS based cryptocurrency that uses the scrypt + chacha20/8 (N,1,1) hashing algorithm, with N gradually rising over time to increase memory requirements. This, in theory, makes Platinum-Core-Coin one of the very few alt coins that can be mined efficiently on a CPU. This means that almost any computer (new or old) can be used to mine Platinum-Core-Coin!



Uses the scrypt + chacha20/8 (N,1,1) hashing algorithm. N increases over time to increase memory requirements. 1 minute PoW block targets. 10 minute PoS block targets. The PoW subsidy decreases as difficulty increases. Maximum PoW reward is 100 coins.
